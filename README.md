# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Steps to Deploy the Application using AWS Management Console

1. **Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk**
   - Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and search for **Elastic Beanstalk**.

2. **Create a New Application**
   - **Application name**: e.g., `MyWeatherApp`.
   - **Environment name**: Provide a unique name for your environment.
   - **Platform**: Select **PHP**.
   - **Application code**: Choose **Sample application** to deploy a default sample app.
   - **Environment type**: Choose **Single instance**.

3. **Create Service Role and EC2 Instance Role**
   - **Service Role**:
     - Create a service role with the following policies:
       - `AWSElasticBeanstalkManagedUpdatesCustomerRolePolicy`
       - `AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth`
       - `AWSElasticBeanstalkService`
       - `AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role`
       - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier`
   - **EC2 Instance Role**:
     - Create an EC2 Instance Profile with the following policies:
       - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier`

4. **Configure the Environment**
   - Choose the appropriate **architecture** (e.g., 64-bit) and **instance type** (e.g., `t2.micro`).
   - Add any necessary **environment variables** required for your application.

5. **Create the Environment**
   - AWS Elastic Beanstalk will provision resources such as EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Auto Scaling, and security groups.
   - Wait for the environment to finish setting up.

## Steps to Implement CI/CD Pipeline with Elastic Beanstalk and GitHub

1. **Navigate to CodePipeline**
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for **CodePipeline** and click **Create Pipeline**.

2. **Create a New Pipeline**
   - **Pipeline Name**: Provide a name for the pipeline (e.g., `MyNodeJSPipeline`).
   - **Service Role**: Select **Create new role** to let AWS create the necessary permissions for the pipeline.

3. **Set Up Source (GitHub)**
   - **Source Provider**: Select **GitHub**.
   - **Connect GitHub**: Click **Connect to GitHub** and authorize AWS access to your GitHub account.
   - **Select Repository and Branch**: Choose the **GitHub repository** and **branch** to deploy from.
   - Select **specify filter** as the trigger, **Push** as the Event type and **Branch** as the Filter type.

4. **Configure Build Stage**
   - **Build Provider**: Choose **AWS CodeBuild**.
   - **Create Build Project**: Provide a name for the project (e.g., `MyNodeJS`).
   - **Buildspec**: Ensure that a `buildspec.yml` file exists in the root directory of your GitHub repository.
   
5. **Set Up Deploy Stage**
   - **Deploy Provider**: Choose **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
   - **Application Name and Environment**: Select the **Application Name** and **Environment** created earlier in Elastic Beanstalk.

6. **Create the Pipeline**
   - Review the pipeline settings and click **Create Pipeline**. This will automatically start building and deploying your application on commits.
